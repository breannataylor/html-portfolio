<h1>The Best Toners According to Reina</h1>
<h2>The Best Toners for Dry, Sentisive, and Early Stage Aging Skin</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Klairs Supple Preparation Facial Toner</h3>

<p>This toner is my go to, my pocket pick. Without a shadow of a doubt, this toner is something I would recommend everyone try once, but especially if someone has dry or sensitive skin. I decided to try it after watching a video from a Youtuber called KennieJD. The formula is viscous due to the high concentration of Natto Gum, so it glides across the skin more like a thin serum, and does not have that slight drying effect that a lot of more watery toners. It gives my skin a longlasting moisutre that I find irresistable. </p>

<h3>Good Molecules Niacinamide Brightening Toner</h3>

<p>This is my go to when I have hyperpigmentation I am trying to get rid of. It contains a good amount of ingredients that are excellent at lightening pigmentation, which made it a perfect foundation for my hyperpighmentation routine. It's consistency and ingredients make it have a drying effect to my skin, but I quickly follow it up with my actives and a very thick, ceramide and vitamin filled moisturizer, so I'm not phased by that at all.</p>

<h3>The Ordinary Marine Hyaluronic Moisture Lock Serum</h3>

<p>This serum was something I picked up on a whim. I already am in love with a lot of products from The Ordinary, so I decided to give it a shot. I think this is another great baseline toner for a variety of skin types, but it does those with sensitive skin very well. It feels like putting water on your face, without that instant drying effect that normally happens to my dry skin with I use a toner with a more water like texture. It's price point makes it really accessible and it's glass container makes it's easy to reuse (which is always a major plus for me!)</p>
